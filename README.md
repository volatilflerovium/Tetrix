# Tetrix
Basic Tetrix

Basic functionality: remove filled rows.

- Applied concepts:

	- Singleton
	- factory design pattern
	- lambda function
	- linked data structure

Comments:

- made from scratch. Never seen any implementation before.

- the board class could have been implemented in a simple way by using std::vector
	however it would have involved juggling more with index. I wanted to use a dual 
	linked list type of data structure to demostrate the concept.
	
- use of lambda functions. I have used lambda functions in some part of the code, again
just to demostrate the concept, however I am aware it could have been simplified by
defining a proper method to do the job.

- working on some improments now...
